 * Client-Side Javascript libraries such as bootstrap, jquery, angular, react, request, etc are all welcome to be used.


### Following requirements should be met: 

 * Versions of the code should be tracked on GitHub repositories 
 * Team Budget Planner should work properly
 * There is no backend required.   There is no database required. All business logic should be implemented in client-side javascript.
